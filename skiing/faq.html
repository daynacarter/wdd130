            <h2>I’ve never skied before but want to start learning! What is the best ski’s for a beginner?</h2>
            <p>Great question! We always recommend getting shorter ski’s that have a softer flex. Pick out ski’s that aren’t taller than your chest and that should make your first time the most enjoyable. We always recommend getting lessons at whatever resort you choose and be safe!</p>
