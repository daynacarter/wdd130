      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When’s the last time you went to a ski resort and were hesitant to purchase expensive skis? I’ve lived in Idaho for eighteen years and have found the beauty of enjoying the snow that Idaho’s winters bring. I began skiing when I was six and now have fourteen years of experience. Through lots of trial and error, with endless different ski gear, I have come to realize that there needs to be products that are affordable and that are higher quality. My company’s purpose is to create a website with quality ski gear such as skis, boots, and bindings that are more affordable. When’s the last time you purchased your favorite ski’s and weren’t satisfied with the quality? I’m here to give you the top quality and affordability that you are looking for. Here’s to a place where everyone can enjoy and discover the beauty of skiing.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will be teenagers, all the way up to late adulthood. Teenagers will be the youngest audience members because anyone younger will most likely not be on this webpage. The audience wants cheap, and quality gear that will last them several winter seasons. The website needs to be exciting and made easy for any customers to navigate through. The website also needs to catch the audience’s attention from the moment they enter the website, or else we could potentially lose them to a different website. The audience will be thrilled by the products and site that they will receive.</p>  <!-- change this -->
