        <h2>Dayna Carter</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Dayna Carter and I am from Shelley, Idaho which is only 45 minutes away from Rexburg. I currently don't know what I want to major in but am considering doing web design and development or business management specializing in marketing. I married the love of my life last March and have loved every second of it. I love to ski, snowboard, be around family and friends, go boating, ride dirtbikes, play the piano, and basically anything that is active. </p>
    <p>I am greatful for a wonderdul school we are all attending and love the professors and peers i get to meet each semester. I am taking this course because I think it will be fun to learn and help me decide what to do as a career. My biggest dream is to become a stay at home mom, but would love to have a degree if I ever needed to use in the future. I'm so excited to learn more about web development and to learn from each and everyone of you!</p>
